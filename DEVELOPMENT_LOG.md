**AI Strategy Simulator — Session Progress Tracking**

---

## Session 1: January 20, 2026 — Analysis & Documentation Buildup

**Status:** Exploration phase completed. Prototype analyzed. Transition to research system phase initiated.

### What Was Done
1. ✅ **Analyzed prototype codebase** (Version 1)
   - Found: eval_policy.py crashes (wrong return value unpacking)
   - Found: Core models unused (innovation.py, market_shocks.py, strategy_factors.py)
   - Found: Requirements.txt empty
   - Found: No tests, no documentation

2. ✅ **Fixed immediate bugs**
   - Fixed eval_policy.py return value handling
   - Fixed action vector reshaping
   - Added error handling

3. ✅ **Created documentation** (10+ files)
   - QUICKSTART, ANALYSIS_REPORT, VISUAL_SUMMARY, CHECKLIST, INDEX
   - docs/version1_design.md, WHAT_IS_V1.md, FIXES_SUMMARY.md, etc.
   - Full test suite (14 tests)
   - requirements.txt

### Issues Encountered
1. **Negative rewards** (-240k cumulative) during evaluation
   - Root cause: Economic model broken (prices < marginal cost)
   - Model learned to price at $4.07 when cost was $20/unit
   - All 3 agents converged to identical bad strategy

2. **VecNormalize signature mismatch**
   - reset() returns 1 value, not 2 (when VecNormalize wrapped)
   - step() returns 4 values, not 5 (when VecNormalize wrapped)

### Outcome
- Prototype validated as experimental sandbox ✓
- Architecture issues identified ✓
- Economics broken, but conceptually sound ✓
- Decision: Freeze prototype, rebuild clean MARL system ✓

## Session 2: January 21, 2026 — Economics Specification & Documentation Consolidation

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE. Full economic specification locked. Documentation consolidated to 3 core files. Ready to code MarketEnvMultiV1.

### What Was Done
1. ✅ **Finalized economic model specification**
   - Profit function: π_i = P_i·Q_i − C_m·Q_i − k·(R&D)² − C_capital − C_compliance
   - Demand system: Softmax competition + price elasticity + substitute pressure
   - Cost structure: Marginal + capital + R&D (quadratic) + compliance (fixed + variable)
   - Innovation: Stock accumulation with time-varying effectiveness
   - Regulation: Price cap [C_m+ε, P_max], compliance cost
   - Shocks: Markov economic cycles, supplier volatility, substitute pressure
   - Episode: 200 steps (50 years), γ=0.99
   - Parameters: 15+ concrete values calibrated for oligopoly

2. ✅ **Answered 7 clarifying questions**
   - Exogenous shocks: Hybrid Markov + stochastic
   - Price cap: Hard constraint in action space
   - Demand elasticity: Separate from softmax (no double-counting)
   - Concrete parameters: All specified (D₀=1000, C_base=80, etc.)
   - Innovation effectiveness: β(t) increases with time, diminishes with saturation
   - Episode length: 200 steps, γ=0.99
   - Compliance: Fixed + variable (volume-scaled)

3. ✅ **Consolidated documentation**
   - Deleted 10+ unnecessary files
   - Kept 3 core files:
     - README.md: Project vision + both versions
     - docs/ECONOMICS.md: Full economic specification
     - DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md: This log
   - Removed: QUICKSTART_V1, ANALYSIS_REPORT, VISUAL_SUMMARY, CHECKLIST, INDEX, version1_design, WHAT_IS_V1, FIXES_SUMMARY, ANALYSIS_COMPLETE, ISSUES_FIXES_SUMMARY

### Key Decisions Made
- **Research goal locked:** Study emergent competitive strategy in oligopolies
- **Economics locked:** Fully operationalized, no ambiguity
- **Architecture locked:** MarketEnvMultiV1 (clean MARL) → PPO self-play → evaluation → research
- **Philosophy locked:** Observe emergent behavior, don't prescribe outcomes
- **Next phase:** Build clean environment, test, validate

### Outcome
- Economics fully specified ✓
- Documentation streamlined ✓
- 3 players will compete, we observe what happens ✓
- Ready to code ✓

## Session 3: January 21, 2026 — MarketEnvMultiV1 Implementation

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE. Core environment built. All tests passing. Ready for training.

### What Was Done

1. ✅ **Built MarketEnvMultiV1** (version1/env/market_env_multi_v1.py)
   - Clean PettingZoo ParallelEnv, no legacy code
   - 3 agents, full economic specification operationalized
   - Action space: [price, R&D] per agent
   - Observation space: Full state (prices, innovation, shares, costs, demand, regime)
   - Reward: Profit = Revenue − Costs − R&D − Capital − Compliance
   - Market share allocation via softmax: S_i = exp(−α·P_i + β(t)·I_i)
   - Demand calculation: D = D₀ × exp(−ε·P_avg) × (1−SubstitutePressure) × CycleMultiplier
   - Cost structure: Marginal (with supplier shocks) + R&D (quadratic) + Capital + Compliance
   - Innovation stocks: Accumulate linearly, cost quadratically
   - Price constraints: Hard bounds [C_m + margin, P_max]
   - Exogenous shocks:
     - Economic cycles: Markov switching (Boom↔Recession, 95%/90% stay rates)
     - Supplier shocks: Lognormal with σ=0.05
     - Substitute pressure: Random walk bounded [0.05, 0.30]
   - Parameters: All 15+ values from docs/ECONOMICS.md

2. ✅ **Built Self-Play Training Loop** (version1/agents/train_marl.py)
   - AsyncVectorEnv for 4 parallel environments
   - VecNormalize for obs/reward normalization
   - 3 independent PPO agents, simultaneous learning
   - Per-agent PPO models with tunable hyperparameters
   - Model checkpointing and vecnormalize stats saved
   - Periodic evaluation during training

3. ✅ **Built Evaluation Tournament** (version1/agents/eval_tournament.py)
   - Load trained models from disk
   - Run 10-episode tournament, 200 steps per episode
   - Log all market dynamics to CSV
   - Output: prices, quantities, innovation, market shares, cumulative profits
   - Calculate HHI (market concentration)
   - Aggregate statistics: avg prices, market shares, profits, innovation levels
   - Deterministic evaluation (no exploration noise)

4. ✅ **Comprehensive Test Suite** (version1/tests/test_market_env_multi_v1.py)
   - **14 tests, all passing** ✅
   - Environment basics: init, reset, step
   - Deterministic reset with seeds
   - Economics validation:
     - Firms can earn positive profits
     - Price constraints enforced
     - Demand decreases with higher avg price
     - Market shares always sum to 1.0
     - Innovation stocks accumulate correctly
   - Shock processes:
     - Economic regime switching between boom/recession
     - Substitute pressure stays in bounds [0.05, 0.30]
   - Episode termination: correct episode length
   - Observation format: correct shape (17 dims), all finite values

5. ✅ **Quick-Start Training Script** (quick_train.py)
   - One-command training: `python quick_train.py`
   - Quick demo mode: `python quick_train.py --quick` (10k steps, ~1 min)
   - Full training: 300k timesteps with 4 parallel envs (~30 min)
   - Auto-runs tournament evaluation after training

### Validation Results

✅ **Environment Mechanics**
- Resets to feasible initial state
- Steps without crashes
- Produces finite observations and rewards
- Correct observation shapes

✅ **Economic Behavior**
- Agents earn positive profits (not negative like v1)
- Prices stay in feasible range
- Demand responds correctly to competition
- Market shares sum to 1.0 always
- Innovation costs scale quadratically
- Exogenous shocks applied correctly

✅ **Test Coverage**
```
Passed: 14/14 tests
├── Environment Basics (4 tests) ✓
├── Economic Model (5 tests) ✓
├── Shock Processes (2 tests) ✓
├── Episode Termination (1 test) ✓
└── Observation Format (2 tests) ✓
```

### Known Limitations
- Training loop uses basic synchronous PPO (not state-of-the-art async)
- No curriculum or curriculum learning
- No explicit Nash equilibrium calculation (will analyze ex-post)
- Dashboard not yet updated to new environment API

### Next Steps

1. **Run full training:**
   ```bash
   python quick_train.py  # 300k steps
   ```
   Expected: Agents learn to maintain positive-profit prices (150-200 range)
   
2. **Analyze tournament results:**
   - Open `version1/experiments/logs/evaluation/tournament_results.csv`
   - Look for price clustering, market concentration, profit distribution
   
3. **Research questions to answer:**
   - Do agents collude or compete? (Check price dispersion)
   - What's the emergent market structure? (Check HHI)
   - How does innovation affect pricing? (Correlation analysis)
   - Do shocks cause strategic shifts? (Regime analysis)

4. **Dashboard visualization:**
   - Update v1_dashboard.py to read from new env
   - Visualize tournament results over time

**Success criteria:**
- Environment runs without crashes
- Agents learn positive-profit strategies
- Prices in reasonable range (not collapsed)
- Innovation investment nonzero and meaningful
- Market shares distribute (not all identical)
- Shocks handled correctly
- Convergence visible over 200 steps

**Estimated timeline:** 4-6 hours implementation + testing
